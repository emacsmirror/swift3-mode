# swift3-mode

This project has been merged into [swift-emacs/swift-mode](https://github.com/swift-emacs/swift-mode). Please use it.

Major-mode for Apple's [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

This is a fork of [chrisbarrett/swift-mode](https://github.com/chrisbarrett/swift-mode) with a new indentation engine, supporting Swift 3.

## Installation

Install `swift3-mode` package from MELPA.

To install without MELPA, download [latest release](https://github.com/taku0/swift3-mode/releases) and execute `M-x package-install-file`.

## Features

- Font Lock
- Indentation

  ```swift
  switch foo {
  case let .P1(x)
         where
           x > 0,
       let .P2(x)
         where
           x > 0:
      bar()
        .then { x in
            return baz(x)
        }
        .then {(
                 x,
                 y
               ) in
            return moo(x + y)
        }
  }

  // Hanging brace
  let x = [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ]

  // Brace on its own line
  let y =
    [
      1,
      2,
      3
    ]

  // Utrecht style
  let z =
    [ 1
    , 2
    , 3
    ]
  ```

This package does not provide flycheck. See [flycheck-swift](https://github.com/swift-emacs/flycheck-swift).

## Limitations

Some syntax constructs removed from Swift 3.0 are not supported:

- C-style for-loop: `for var i = 1; i < 10; i++ { }`
- Multiple assignments in single `if let`:
  ```swift
  if let x = x,
         y = y {
  }
  ```

  Use multiple `let` instead:
  ```swift
  if let x = x,
     let y = y {
  }
  ```

Indentation may not accurate. For example, `foo(Bar < A, B > (c))` is ambiguous. It is indented like either
```swift
foo(Bar < A,
    B > (c)) // Passing two Boolean arguments to foo
```
or
```swift
foo(Bar < A,
          B > (c)) // constructing Bar with two type arguments and a value
```
The Swift compiler disambiguates this case using tokens after `>`, but those tokens may not available in editing time. We use some heuristic for this.

Another example is difficulty of handling of colons. We have to pair all `?` and `:` of conditional operators to decide indentation. This is a future work.

```swift
switch foo {
  case let P(x) where x is Foo? ? a ? b : c ?? d : e ? f : g :
    h ? i?.j() : k()
}

switch foo {
  case let P(x) where (x is Foo?) ? (a ? b : c ?? d) : (e ? f : g) :
    h ? i?.j() : k()
}
```

Yet another difficult case is consistency of blocks. We want to indent method chains like this:
```swift
var x = foo
  .then { x in
      aaa
  }
  .then { x in
      aaa
  }
```

while we also want to indent if body like this:

```swift
if anotherVeryLongVariableName
     .veryLongPropertyName {
    aaa
}
```

Then, how should we indent this when the cursor is before `@`?

```swift
var x = foo
  .bar {
    @
```

This could be
```swift
var x = foo
  .bar {
    @abc willSet {
        aaa
    }
}
```
or
```swift
var x = foo
  .bar {
      @abc var x = 1
      x
  }
```

Both are syntactically correct code. We cannot handle this case properly. This is also a future work.

## Hacking

To build the package locally, run `make package`. You need [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask).

To install the built package, run `make install`.

To run tests, run `make check`.

For other commands, run `make help`.
